"Congratulations, Player.

You've signed in blood and survived this round.
But remember: in the Squid Game, the Front Man is always watching.

Some paths aren't as clean as they look.
Watch for nails in the floorboards, forks in the road, and the things no one talks about.

Your next move will decide everything."
